🕵️ Theft Detection System using YOLOv8 & MediaPipe
📌 Overview

This project implements an AI-powered theft detection system that monitors real-time video streams using YOLOv8 for object detection and MediaPipe for human pose estimation.
The system detects suspicious interactions (like a person concealing an object) and generates alerts automatically.
